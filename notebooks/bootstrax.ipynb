    "Bootstrax has a crash-only / recovery first philosophy. Any error in the core code causes a crash; there is no nice exit or mandatory cleanup. Boostrax focuses on recovery after restarts: before starting work, we look for and fix any mess left by crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that hangs and hard crashes do not require expert tinkering to repair databases. Plus, you can just stop the program with ctrl-c (or pulling the machine's power plug) at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors during run processing are assumed to be retry-able. We track the number of failures per run to decide how long to wait until retries; only if a user marks the run as 'abandoned' (using an external system, e.g. the website) do we stop retrying."
